## Versioning
For Alpha and Beta releases, versioning will follow the format `vA.B.C-alpha/beta`, where:

- `A` represents major changes,
- `B` represents minor changes, and
- `C` represents patches.

After the Alpha/Beta phase, versioning will transition to `vYEAR.ROUND.SESSION(.PATCH)`, where:

- `YEAR` corresponds to the year in which the release is released,
- `ROUND` represents the round number of the Grand Prix within the season,
- `SESSION` represents the session number in the round, and
- `(.PATCH)` denotes a possible mid-round patch.

For example:

- `v1.0.0-beta` indicates the first beta release.
- `v2024.03.01` indicates the release of the 2024 Formula 1 season, round 3, session 1.
